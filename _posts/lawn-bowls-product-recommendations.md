## Best bowls for indoors 

For me, the best bowl for indoors is the **Henselite Tiger II**. It is a classic model that has been around for an age, but has earned it's place at the top.

The Tiger II is Henselite's sits in between the extremely narrow Tiger TX and the mid-biased Tiger Pro, and offers a nice, steady drawing arch to the jack.

For those who like to buy second hand, you're in luck as the Henselite Tiger II has a great second hand market, and can be picked up for around Â£120.

## Best bowls outdoors

My favourite outdoor bowl is the **Drakes Pride Pro-50**. The Pro-50 has the same great draw arch as the ever popular Drakes Pride Professional, but it comes with Drakes Prides' embedded grip.

The Pro-50 is also a decent mid-biased bowl, and is more than at home on indoor runks too.

The Pro-50 isn't as common on online marketplaces such as eBay, but it is more than worth the investment for a brand new set.


## Best bowls for short mat 

The best bowl for short mat bowls is **Taylor Lignoid**. For short mat bowls you want a model with plenty of bend, and you won't go too far wrong with the Lignoid.

The Lignoid is Taylor's heaviest biased bowl, sitting just above the Legacy SL. The heavy bend will make sure you are getting around the block with ease.

Whilst something like a Drakes Pride Professional will also do very well, my personal preference is with the Lignoid.


## Best bowls for beginners

Without doubt, the best lawn bowl for beginners is the **Drakes Pride Professional**. As a beginner you want something that will last as well as something that is flexible, as you are yet to find what you like the best about bowls.

This is exactly what you get with the Professional. It is a great mid-biased bowl which means it will be great for both indoors and outdoor play.

Its steady draw arch means it is much easier to control compared to something with a hooked finish - such as the Taylor International.

The Professional model can also be picked up pretty cheaply on second hand marketplaces - The Drakes Pride Professional is actually one of the cheapest bowls you can buy, which is great for newcomers to the game.
