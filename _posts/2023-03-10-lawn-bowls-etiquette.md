## Be punctual

Being punctual is an essential part of lawn bowls etiquette, and it is crucial to arrive on time for a game. Firstly, arriving on time demonstrates respect for the game, the players, and the officials involved. 

It shows that you value their time and effort and that you are committed to playing the game fairly and properly. By being punctual, you also avoid causing delays or disrupting the game, which is important for evening games, as you must be finished before it gets dark.

Arriving on time also allows you to prepare properly for the game. This includes warming up, and selecting the right equipment (don't want to forget that rain mack!). These preparations are necessary to ensure that you can play to the best of your ability. 

Being punctual also shows that you are a reliable and responsible player. It demonstrates your commitment to the game and your team, and it helps to build a positive reputation for you as a player. 

This can be important in the long run, especially if you want to be selected for future games or if you wish to participate in competitions and tournaments.


## Respect the game

Respecting the game encompasses several aspects of etiquette. 

Firstly, respecting the game means playing by the rules and abiding by the spirit of the game. This includes showing honesty and fairness, treating opponents with respect, and avoiding any behavior that could be considered unsportsmanlike.

Secondly, respecting the game involves maintaining the playing surfaces and equipment in good condition. This includes taking care of the greens, avoiding unnecessary damage or wear and tear, and ensuring that the equipment is clean and properly maintained. This shows a commitment to the game and a willingness to preserve its traditions and standards for future generations.

Finally, respecting the game means showing appreciation for its history, culture, and significance. This includes understanding the origins of the game, the achievements of past players and recognizing the role that the game plays in promoting social interaction, physical activity, and mental wellbeing.


## Wear appropriate clothing

Wearing appropriate clothing and shoes is an essential aspect of lawn bowls etiquette. The game is played on a grass surface, which requires players to wear suitable footwear that provides grip and stability.

Besides footwear, players should also consider wearing comfortable and modest clothing that allows for ease of movement. Typically, players wear white or neutral-colored clothing. 

Additionally, wearing a hat or visor can help protect players from the sun's harmful rays and provide better visibility in bright sunlight.

Wearing appropriate clothing and shoes shows respect for the game, the players, and the club. It demonstrates a player's understanding of the rules and expectations of the sport and the club. 

It also reflects the player's commitment to the game and the community. In addition, proper attire can enhance a player's performance, providing them with the necessary comfort and support to play their best. 

## Don't interrupt play

Not interrupting play is a fundamental rule of lawn bowls etiquette. The game requires concentration and focus from the players, and any disruption can affect their performance. Walking behind the green can distract the players, while making noise can disturb the players' concentration and disrupt the flow of the game.

It is crucial to respect the players' concentration and focus during the game. Any interruption, no matter how small, can cause the players to lose their momentum, and it takes time to regain their focus. Even if it is necessary to cross the green, it should be done as quickly and quietly as possible. If someone accidentally interrupts play, they should apologize and move away from the green immediately to avoid further disruption.

## Don't stand in the head

The head is the area where the bowls come to rest after being played, and it is where the score is determined. Standing in the head can interfere with the players' ability to see the bowls and determine the score accurately. It can also affect the players' ability to play their next shots as they may not have a clear view of the head.

Additionally, interfering with the bowls that have been played can be seen as disrespectful to the players and the game. Each player takes great care in playing their bowls, and any interference can be seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of the game. 

It is important to allow the players to play the game fairly and without interference.

## Don't smoke on the green

Not smoking on the green is a crucial part of lawn bowls etiquette. Smoking on the green is not only disrespectful to the players but also poses a risk to the environment and can damage the grass. Smoking can also interfere with players' ability to concentrate and affect their performance.

Lawn bowls is a social sport, and players often spend several hours on the green. As such, players should show respect for each other's health and well-being by avoiding smoking on the green. 

Smoking is also not a good look for the sport and can negatively impact the image of the game.

## Don't use foul language

Lawn bowls is a sport that values respect, sportsmanship, and fair play, and the use of foul language goes against these values. Using foul language can be disrespectful and offensive to other players and spectators, and it can create a negative atmosphere on the green.

Lawn bowls is a social sport, and players often play in mixed teams or with people of different ages and backgrounds. Using foul language can be inappropriate and uncomfortable for some players, and it can make them feel unwelcome or excluded. 

It is essential to create a welcoming and inclusive environment on the green, and avoiding the use of foul language is one way to achieve this.

## Shake hands

Finally you should always shake hands with your opponent after a game. It is a way for players to show their respect for each other and the game. It is a tradition that has been followed for many years and is an integral part of the sport's culture.

Lawn bowls is a sport that values sportsmanship and fair play, and the act of shaking hands and saying thank you at the end of a game is a way of acknowledging the efforts of both players. 

It is also a way of showing appreciation for the opportunity to play the game and for the time and effort that both players have put in.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, lawn bowls is a sport that values respect, sportsmanship, and fair play. 

Etiquette plays a vital role in maintaining these values and ensuring that the game is played in a respectful and fair manner. From wearing appropriate clothing and shoes to shaking hands and saying thank you at the end of a game, every rule of etiquette is designed to promote a positive and inclusive environment on the green. 

By observing these rules of etiquette, players demonstrate their respect for the traditions and values associated with the game and help to maintain the integrity of the sport. 

Ultimately, by upholding these values and observing the rules of etiquette, players can ensure that lawn bowls remains a sport that is enjoyed by all for generations to come.
