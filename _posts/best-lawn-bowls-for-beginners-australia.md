## The criteria

Before we jump into the recommendations I just want to run through how this list was compiled.

Lets look at the characteristics that I mentioned above:
- affordable
- comfortable
- suit the style of game you will be playing

Therefore, I have chosen models that have:

- good availablity in the second hand market - to keep cost down
- have good grip options - this will allow you to comfortably hold the bowl
- have a slightly narrower bias to help drawing to the jack - most beginners play lead, so a good drawing bowl is ideal

Great, now we have got that out the way, lets take a look at the best lawn bowls for beginnners.
