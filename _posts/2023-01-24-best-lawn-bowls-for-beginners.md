Borrowing sets of bowls from your club is a great way to get a taste of lawn bowls, but when you want to commit to playing regularly (and why wouldn't you?!), getting your own set of lawn bowls is crucial.

A good set of lawn bowls for a beginner should be affordable, comfortbale to use, and suit the style of game you will be playing. But it can be tricky to work out which brand and model you should be considering when there are so many on offer.

Fear not, as in this guide I will walk you through what I believe are the best lawn bowls for beginners.

## The criteria

Before we jump into the recommendations I just want to run through how this list was compiled.

Lets look at the characteristics that I mentioned above:
- affordable
- comfortable
- suit the style of game you will be playing

Therefore, I have chosen models that have:

- good availablity in the second hand market - to keep cost down
- have good grip options - this will allow you to comfortably hold the bowl
- have a slightly narrower bias to help drawing to the jack - most beginners play lead, so a good drawing bowl is ideal

Great, now we have got that out the way, lets take a look at the best lawn bowls for beginnners.
