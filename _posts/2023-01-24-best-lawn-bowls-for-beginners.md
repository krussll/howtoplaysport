Borrowing sets of bowls from your club is a great way to get a taste of lawn bowls, but when you want to commit to playing regularly (and why wouldn't you?!), getting your own set of lawn bowls is crucial.

A good set of lawn bowls for a beginner should be affordable, comfortbale to use, and suit the style of game you will be playing. But it can be tricky to work out which brand and model you should be considering when there are so many on offer.

Fear not, as in this guide I will walk you through what I believe are the best lawn bowls for beginners.

## The criteria

Before we jump into the recommendations I just want to run through how this list was compiled.

Lets look at the characteristics that I mentioned above:
- affordable
- comfortable
- suit the style of game you will be playing

Therefore, I have chosen models that have:

- good availablity in the second hand market - to keep cost down
- have good grip options - this will allow you to comfortably hold the bowl
- have a slightly narrower bias to help drawing to the jack - most beginners play lead, so a good drawing bowl is ideal

Great, now we have got that out the way, lets take a look at the best lawn bowls for beginnners.

## Drakes Pride Professional

Its an oldy, but a goody. The Drakes pride professional has been a staple of club bowls for decades, and for good reason.

It is perfectly playable on indoor and outdoor surfaces, so great for those who play all year round. Its one of a group of models, known as "mid-biased" bowls.

A mid biased bowl is one that swings just enough for outdoor greens without becoming uncontrolably wide on faster indoor surfaces.

A Drakes Pride Professional is very durable, and will last you for many years. It can be used in many riles and situations, so you won't "out grow" it when you start playing singles, or "backend" roles in team formats.

### Key features:

- Price: £60-100 (secondhand)
- Best for: All-rounders
- Type: Mid-biased

### Pros

- Durable. Can be used for many surfaces and team roles
- Will hold its value for resale
- Very affordable

### Cons

- Colour options are a bit bland (for those you like a pop of colour in their life)

## Taylor Ace

Much like the Drakes pride Professional, the Taylor Ace has dominated the club level rinnks for years. These are trusted by bowlers, and have been for decades.

They also have a good secondhand market, so a decent set can be bought without costing you the Earth. 

Again, another mid-biased bowl, the Taylor Ace can be used on a multitude of surfaces and team positions. Both the Drakes Pride Professional and taylor Ace have dominated the mid-biased market for sometime.

### Key features:

- Price: £70-£120 (second hand)
- Best for: All-rounders
- Type: Mid-biased

### Pros

- Solid performer that will last you years
- Easy to get hold of second hand
- Nice draw line to the jack

### Cons

- not quite as affordable as the Drakes pride Professional
