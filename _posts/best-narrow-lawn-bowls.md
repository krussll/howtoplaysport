There has been a real trend in bowls towards narrower and narrower biases over the last 15 years. 

Gone are the days of lead bowlers using heavily biased bowls, swinging into an empty head. Some may say this is a shame as it has removed a large element of skill that was required to control these kind of bowls.

However, I believe that the trend has really helped many players get into the game. These bowls are great for newbies, and experienced players alike, bringing a new way to play the game.

In this guide I hope to highlight the best narrow biased bowls around today.

## At a glace

Here are the best narrow biased bowls available today:

* Taylor Vector VS
* Drakes Pride D-TEC
* Biased Racing Line
* Henselite Tiger II

## What is a "narrow-biased" bowl?

Lets just quickly clear this one up. What exactly makes a narrow bowl a "narrow bowl".

A narrow biased bowl is a bowl that has a weak bias. This means that it won't bend as much as other bowls with a mid-to-strong bias. The models in this category have some of the weakest (if not the weakest) biases available for each of the major brands.

There is no specified legal limit on how much a bowl needs to bend in the laws of the sport, so technically you could choose to use a bowl with hardly any bias. However, this would be against the spirit of the game, and leave you rather unpopular with other bowlers.

It is much easier to play a draw shot with a narrow biased bowl, and this is why they are so popular amongst new players and more experienced bowlers who play in the "lead" position.

## Taylor Vector VS

The **Taylor Vector VS** is one of the most popular models in the Taylor range. Taylor offer it as a duel purpose bowl that performs best indoors and on fast-to-medium speed outdoor greens.

It can also play on slower, heavier greens, and it is in these conditions that it is noticeably narrow.

The only model in the Taylor range that has a weaker bias than the Vector VS is the Taylor Lazer - however this is a dedicated indoor bowl, and you would likely find that it would hardly bend at all on many outdoor surfaces.

The Vector VS can also be picked up quite easily on second hand marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace or eBay for around £100-£140, which is much cheaper than many of the other models on this list.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £100-£150 (second hand)
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers/indoor bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow/mid-biased

### Pros

- A narrow bowl, but with enough bias to still handle slow greens
- Good availability on second hand marketplaces
- Comes with Taylor's premium dimple grip - the Progrip - as standard

### Cons

- Isn't currently available with Taylors Xtreme embedded grip


## Drakes Pride D-TEC

The **Drakes Pride D-TEC** is the narrowest model available in the Drakes Pride range, and is listed as a dedicated indoor bowl - however, you can still get good use out of this model on outdoor greens.

The D-TEC sits with a bias just underneath the extremely popular Professional model, so you won't find yourself struggling to find any bend.

The D-TEC offers a smooth hook-free finish which also makes drawing easier. And whilst there isn't much of a second hand market for them, they are competitively priced for a brand new "made to order" bowl.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £225-£290
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow

### Pros

- A predominantly indoor bowl  that can be played outdoors
- A steady narrow line to the jack

### Cons

- Very few available on second hand markets

## Biased Racing Line

Next on the list is the **Biased Racing Line**, which is my curveball option.

Biased Bowls are a new brand on the scene. For those not in the know, they were founded in 2020 with a focus on bringing quality bowls with unique personalisation options.

All of their models are inspired by cars and racing - hence the name "Racing Line". For anyone with experience with racing, the racing line is the quickest way to drive around a corner, which should give you a clue as to how this bowl performs.

Biased Bowls currently offer 2 models, the racing Line and the Torque. Both are duel purpose bowls, with the Racing Line being the narrower of the two.

It may be slightly wider than some of the other models on this list, however it is a great option for those looking for something a bit different.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £385
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers/indoor bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow/mid-biased

### Pros

- Unique personalisation options
- Manufactured by Taylor bowls, so you know they are built well

### Cons

- Might be slightly wider than some of the other bowls mentions. Might be a concern for those only after the narrowest of bowls

## Henselite Tiger II

The **Henselite Tiger II** is a classic choice.

You would be hard pushed to find a rink of club players anywhere in the UK where there isn't someone using a set of these.

The Tiger IIs are one of the narrowest models offered by Henselite, with only the Tiger TX model being narrower. I would recommend the Tiger IIs being the narrowest you should go if you still want to play outdoors.

The Henselite Tiger II is one of the few bowls on this list where an embedded grip is offered as standard. The Henselite Mega grip is ideal for those who are looking for a bit of extra control over the bowl.

As will all embedded grips, the Mega grip sits in a small channel taken out of the shoulder of the bowl, so you fingers sit slightly within the bowl making it feel smaller in your hand.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £100-180 (second hand)/£390-£400 (new)
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow/mid-biased

### Pros

- The Henselite Tiger II is a proven model used by 1000s of bowlers
- Good second hand market options for those looking to spend a bit less
- When bought new they come with Henselite's embedded Mega grip as standard

### Cons

- When bought new, the Henselite Tiger II are one of the most expensive models on this list

## Why choose a narrow-biased bowl

Narrow biased bowls are great for lead bowlers. The narrow bias means the bowl doesn't bend as much as it travels down the green, making it easier to judge your line.

Wider biased bowls can be harder to control, and have less margin for error, as it will swing away quite dramatically if you get your line wrong.

However, it is important to note that narrow biased bowls will have trouble getting around any bowl that is short of the jack, which is why many bowlers only recommend bowling with them if you are a lead.

## Other options

This list is by no means complete. There are several other bowls that could have been included:

- **Aero Quantum**
- **Henselite Tiger Pro**
