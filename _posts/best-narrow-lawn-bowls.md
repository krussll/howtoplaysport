There has been a real trend in bowls towards narrower and narrower biases over the last 15 years. 

Gone are the days of lead bowlers using heavily biased bowls, swinging into an empty head. Some may say this is a shame as it has removed a large element of skill that was required to control these kind of bowls.

However, I believe that the trend has really helped many players get into the game. These bowls are great for newbies, and experienced players alike, bringing a new way to play the game.

In this guide I hope to highlight the best narrow biased bowls around today.

## At a glace

Here are the best narrow baised bowls available today:

* Drakes Pride D-TEC

## What is a "narrow-biased" bowl?

Lets just quickly clear this one up. What exactly makes a narrow bowl a "narrow bowl".

A narrow biased bowl is a bowl that has a weak bias. This means that it won't bend as much as other bowls with a mid-to-strong bias. The models in this category have some of the weakest (if not the weakest) biases available for each of the major brands.

There is no specified legal limit on how much a bowl needs to bend in the laws of the sport, so technically you could choose to use a bowl with hardly any bias. However, this would be against the spirit of the game, and leave you rather unpopular with other bowlers.

It is much easier to play a draw shot with a narrow biased bowl, and this is why they are so popular amongst new players and more experienced bowlers who play in the "lead" position.

## Taylor Vector VS

The **Taylor Vector VS** is one of the most popular models in the Taylor range. Taylor offer it as a duel purpose bowl that performs best indoors and on fast-to-medium speed outdoor greens.

It can also play on slower, heavier greens, and it is in these conditions that it is noticably narrow.

The only model in the Taylor range that has a weaker bias than the Vector VS is the Taylor Lazer - however this is a dedicated indoor bowl, and you would likely find that it would hardly bend at all on many outdoor surfaces.

The Vector VS can also be picked up quite easily on second hand marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace or eBay for around £100-£140, which is much cheaper than many of the other models on this list.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £100-£150 (second hand)
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers/indoor bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow/mid-biased

### Pros

- A narrow bowl, but with enough bias to still handle slow greens
- Good availablity on second hand marketplaces
- Comes with Taylor's premium dimple grip - the Progrip - as standard

### Cons

- Isn't currently available with Taylors Xtreme embedded grip


## Drakes Pride D-TEC

The **Drakes Pride D-TEC** is the narrowest model available in the Drakes Pride range, and is listed as a dedicated indoor bowl - however, you can still get good use out of this model on outdoor greens.

The D-TEC sits with a bias just underneath the extremely popular Professional model, so you won't find yourself struggling to find any bend.

The D-TEC offers a smooth hook-free finish which also makes drawing easier. And whilst there isn't much of a second hand market for them, they are competitively priced for a brand new "made to order" bowl.

### Key features:

- **Price**: £225-£290
- **Best for**: Lead bowlers
- **Type**: Narrow

### Pros



### Cons
