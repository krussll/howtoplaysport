Understanding the different makes and models can be tricky. Each of the 5 major brands of lawn bowls have their own models, with differing levels of bias.

In this guide I will take you through each of the brands and show the bias strengths for all of their UK models.

NOTE: All diagrams are for illustrative purposes only.

## Aero bowls bias chart

Aero offer 3 models on the UK market - the Quantum, GrooVe and Sonic.

Both the Quantum and GrooVe are ideal for indoor and outdoor surfaces, whilst the Sonic is suited mainly to outdoor greens.

## Biased Bowls bias chart

Biased Bowls offers 2 models. The Racing Line, and Torque models.

Both of these are ideal for indoor and outdoor play, with the Racing Line model being the narrower of the 2.

## Drakes Pride bowls bias chart

Drakes Pride offer 4 models - the D-TEC, Professional, PRO-50 and XP.

The D-TEC is primarily an indoor bowl, but can be played on faster outdoor surfaces. The Professional and PRO-50 are essentially the same bowl, but with different grip styles (for illustrative pruposes I have them as slightly different on the chart, but they should behave the same). 

Finally, the XP is an outdoor bowl with the strongest bias in the Drakes Pride range.

## Henselite bowls bias chart

Henselite offer 5 different bowls to the UK market. They are:
- Tiger TX
- Tiger II
- Tiger Pro
- Tiger EVO
- Tiger

The Tiger TX is an indoor bowl, with Henselite's narrowest bias.

Both the Tiger II and Tiger Pro can easily be played indoors and outdoors and are Henselite's mid-biased options.

Finally, the Tiger EVO and Tiger models are for outdoor greens.

## Taylor Bowls bias chart

Taylor has the largest range of models in the UK market with a total of 7 models.

The Lazer and Vector VS are Taylor's indoor models. The Blaze, Ace are great mid-biased options and the International, Legacy SL and Lignoid suited to slower, heavier outdoor greens.
