<div class="overview" markdown="1">

I spent 11 hours testing the International models on the greens and in games, as well as reading reviews from experts and users. In summary:

reasons to buy:

* Great line to the jack
* Great for outdoor greens
* Progrip as standard

reasons to not buy:

* Might run a bit wide on faster indoor rinks
* Not one for those who only play lead

## Bottom line

A fantastic set of bowls. Underrated due to the similarity to the Taylor Ace. The strong finish will favour those playing backend positions, but might not be one for the lead purests. It’s versatile and consistent enough to handle anything you throw at it, especially on the outdoor greens.

## Line analysis

Taylor advertise the International model as running slightly wider than the Ace, with a stronger finish. 

I would recommend this bias for those playing any position outdoors. The International might run a tad wide for those used to narrow lead bowls, but if you play multiple positions throughout the year then the International is adaptable enough to cover you.

After a few ends with the Internationals it is clear to see the strong bias at the end of its trajectory. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s a “hooked” finish, where the bowl dives into the head at the last second, but it’s not a gentle bend in either,

I personally quite like this, as it’s great for playing around short/off-centre bowls. Hooked finished models are going out of fashion with manufacturers, as many point out that they can be susceptible to unpredictable lines, especially on outdoor rinks.

I tested with a set of size 1 Internationals. I normally play with size 2s but wanted to try a size down to see if it could help my grip. I found the sizing to be great, and it fitted in the hand really well.

## Grips and colours

The International comes with Taylor’s Progrip as standard. It is in fact the only grip option available - however this isn’t a draw back. The Progrip is a great variation on the classic “dimple” grip.

I’m a big fan of embedded grips, however the Progrip is far more subtle. Whilst it is noticeably set in compared to an ordinary dimple grip to the eye, it certainly doesn’t feel awkward in the hand.

Available in Taylor’s range of 18 colours. Colour choices are also available on the emblem and rings on the bowl, making it easy for you to find the exact look you are after.

The set I am testing with are in the “White Steel” option. This is a speckled option with a base of white, with a splattering of black throughout.

The speckles are consistent around the bowl, and the contrast is sharp. I’m a big fan of the look of the bowl, and the new modern look ready makes it stand out from the competition.

## Conclusion

The International is a versatile outdoor bowl, which can also be used on some slower indoor surfaces.

With a trajectory similar to the ever popular Ace, and with a price point £35 lower, it is a strong contender.
