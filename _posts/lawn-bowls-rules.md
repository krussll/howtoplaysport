## How to play bowls

A coin is tossed to decide which team bowls first. The first bowler places the mat centrally, and the first bowler rolls the jack to whatever distance they like. The jack must be at least 25 meters from the mat and must stay out of the ditch. Once the jack has come to rest, it is placed centrally by the marker with the help of the bowler. Teams alternate taking shots, and each member of the team will take all of their shots before the next one takes over. When playing any shot, the player bowling must always have one foot on the mat. Any bowls that are in play can be moved by another shot, and they stay active to where they finish. Any bowl that finishes in the ditch is considered out of play. Once all players have finished their shots, the game is scored.

### Equipment needed to play bowls

The basic items needed for a game of bowls are the jack, bowls, and mats. The jack is a small ball used as the target in the game. Bowls are larger balls that players use to roll towards the jack. They weigh no more than 3.5 pounds and are weighted on one side which allows them to curve. The mats are made of rubber and are roughly the size of a door mat. Two mats are required for a game, one is placed at either end of the green.

### Scoring and winning

The winning team gets one point for each bowl that is closer to the jack than their opponent’s nearest bowl. The winning team gets to roll the jack for the next end. 

The team who has received the most points (or “shots”) after all the ends are played is the winner. 

Now that you know the rules, grab your bowls and head to the green for a fun and challenging game of lawn bowls!
