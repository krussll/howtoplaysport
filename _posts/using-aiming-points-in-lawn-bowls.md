first_paragraph: "The 2 'L's are Line and Length - once you have these you will be will on your way. The first 'L' (Line) is the fundemental skill you need to become a good bowler. But how do you find a line? And where do you aim to find it?"

The Line and Length can also be described as "target" and "speed". To get close to the jack you need to roll your bowl towards the right target, with the correct speed so it stops next to the jack.

The first skill you should focus on when you start bowling is learning to find that target (hint, the target isn't the jack!), then finding the right speed will become easier.

## What is a "line" in bowls?

To understand lines we first have to look at how a lawn bowl travels down a rink.

A bowl doesn't travel in a straight line. It will curve either to the left or the right depending on which way around the bowl is held - as one half is shaped differently to the other it will bend towards the lighter side (aslo known as a bias).

Therefore to get the bowl to finish in the centre of the rink you need to roll your bowl _away_ from the centre, so the bowl can curve back in to the correct place.

Lets look at an example of how a bowl will bend.

In this diagram we can see:

- the jack (the white circle at the far end of the rink)
- the centre line (the white dotted line up the middle)
- the perfect line on the left hand-side of the rink (the red line)
- the perfect line on the right hand-side of the rink (the orange line)
- 

**The "Line" in bowls refers to the direction you roll the bowl. "Finding the line" is when you have found the exact distance away from the jack so that the bowl bends just enough to finish inline with it.**

To send our bowl along the correct path we must imagine a line that extends beyond the point where the bowl will turn, and imagine we are bowling along that line, as if it's not going to turn.

If you were to roll the bowl along either the red dotted line, or the orange dotted line (our new imaginary line) your bowl will travel along the solid line and end up somewhere along the centre line, and you would have found your line.

To find the line you have to constantly adjust this imaginary line in your head (either moving to the left or the right) until your bowl finishes in the centre of the rink.

For the rest of this guide I will refer back to this diagram to look at:

- and where to aim
- how to find your line

## Where to aim in bowls

Before we can start to talk about how to find the line, we first need an aiming point - as this will be critical.

There are 4 places you can look when you delivery the bowl. Which one you use will be down to your personal preference. The places are:

1. somewhere along the line behind the rink
2. the point where your line reaches the same distance as the jack
3. the point where the bowl starts to turn (also known as the "shoulder")
4. along your line 3-4 yards in front of you

Lets look at each one in turn.

## How to pick your line in bowls

So now you know what the perfect line is, how do you find it?
