first_paragraph: "The 2 'L's are Line and Length - once you have these you will be will on your way. The first 'L' (Line) is the fundemental skill you need to become a good bowler. But how do you find a line? And where do you aim to find it?"

The Line and Length can also be described as "target" and "speed". To get close to the jack you need to roll your bowl towards the right target, with the correct speed so it stops next to the jack.

The first skill you should focus on when you start bowling is learning to find that target (hint, the target isn't the jack!), then finding the right speed will become easier.

## What is a "line" in bowls?

To understand lines we first have to look at how a lawn bowl travels down a rink.

A bowl doesn't travel in a straight line. It will curve either to the left or the right depending on which way around the bowl is held - as one half is shaped differntly to the other it will bend towards the lighter side (aslo known as a bias).

Therefore to get the bowl to finish in the centre of the rink you need to roll your bowl _away_ from the centre, so the bowl can curve back in to the correct place.

**The "Line" in bowls refers to the direction you roll the bowl. "Finding the line" is when you have found the exact distance away from the jack so that the bowl bends just enough to finish inline with it.**

In this diagram we can see:

- the jack (the white circle at the far end of the rink)
- the centre line (the white dotted line up the middle)
- the perfect line on the left hand-side of the rink (the red line)
- the perfect line on the right hand-side of the rink (the orange line)

If you were to roll the bowl along either the red line, or the orange line your bowl will end up somewhere along the centre line, and you would have found your line.

For the rest of this guide I will refer back to this diagram to look at:

- how to find your line
- and where to aim
