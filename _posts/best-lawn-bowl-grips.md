So many of the issues I see with bolwer's deliveries boil down to the grip. The grip is the first thing you do before you deliver, and is the last contact point afterwards, so it is central to everything you do in bowls.

Beginners often get confused with how they should grip their bowl, and struggle because of it. In this guide I will go through the 3 common gripping techniques, how to learn them, and run through which one might be best for you.

## Types of grips on lawn bowls

There are actually 3 common gripping techniques these are:

- Claw
- Cradle
- Scoop

The one you choose will depend on many factors (which we will look at later). For now, lets look at each technique in turn.

## Claw

The claw grip is where you place your fingers across the running surface of the bowl - your index and pinky will often sit along the grips on the shoulder of the bowl - with your thumb on top of the bowl.

Your thumb can sit either along the running surface of the bowl, or along the grip.

The main feature of the Claw grip is that the palm of the hand is off the bowl. There should be a noticable gap between the palm of the hand and the bowl itself.

## Cradle

The Cradle grip is where the bowl is held almost entirely in the palm of the hand. Your fingers and thumb are all along the running surface of the bowl or holding the bowl by the grip on the underside of it.

The Cradle is almost as if you are cupping the bowl.

## Scoop

The Scoop grip is a combination of the cradle and the Claw. The fingers and thumb are placed similarly to the Claw, but the palm is also used to hold the bowl.

You know when you are holding your bowl in the correct Scoop grip when you can see your thumb and index finger in a "C" shape along the grip of the bowl.

## How to choose which technique to use

Now we know what the 3 main ways to grop a bowl are, and how to do them correctly, its time to look at when to use them.

Its important to understand that you can (and often will) change your grip depending on the circumstances. As you are about to see, your grip can be changed to suit many common bowls issues.
