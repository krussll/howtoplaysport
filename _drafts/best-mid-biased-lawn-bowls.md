Selecting a new set of bowls can be a tricky business, especially for those who play indoor and outdoor.

The conditions can be very different and require very different characteristics from your set of bowls.

Therefore it’s easy to see why mid-baised bowls are so popular. In this guide I’ll show why mid-biased bowls are so good, and pick out some of my favourites.

## Why use mid-biased bowls

Mid biased bowls are the most durable and multi-purpose bowls around. They are great all-rounders, and allow the bowler to be adaptable to surface and the position in the team they are playing in.

Mid-biased bowls are ideal for almost any condition and green speed. By definition a mid-biased bowl will be perfectly at home on an indoor carpet. This is a huge help for those who want to play all year round, but don’t want to pay for a second set of bowls.

## Drawbacks to using Mid-baised bowls

Whilst I’m a huge fan of mid-baised bowls (I even play with a set myself) there are drawbacks to using them.

My main issue with them is they work on the extremes of the conditions - especially in the UK. What do I mean by this?

When playing indoors they will likely be one of the widest drawing models on the rink, this will make them difficult to play lead - or any front-end role - in a team. 

However compare this to playing outdoors, when they bowl will play on the narrow side, this will make it difficult to play skip - or most kinds of back-end roles - in a team.

Why is this a problem? Most players will predominantly play either a lead role, or a skip role. By having a mid biased bowl you are hindering yourself in either indoor or outdoor conditions.

Simply re-aligning your delivery stance to account for a much wider drawing line indoors and a narrower one outdoors can be problematic.

If you are a serious indoor AND outdoor bowler, I recommend buying two sets of bowls tailored to your needs.

## Best Mid-Biased Lawn Bowl - UK

**Taylor Ace**

It’s a toss-up for me between the **Taylor Ace** and the **Aero Groove**. Both brands are at the forefront of bowls development, and the move to embedded grips is the future of bowls.

However, as the Ace is cheaper than the Groove, and the second hand market is far more mature, I would recommend the Ace for a club level bowler.

## Best Mid-Biased Lawn Bowl Australia

**Drakes Pride Conquest**

I could quite easily suggest the Aero Groove here too, but I think the Drakes Pride Conquest is the best mid-biased lawn bowl for Australia.

Once again, I’m going for one of the most popular bowls currently available. A consistent bowl perfect for all surfaces.

## Best Mid Biased Bowls - UK Models

Here are the short list of the most popular mid-biased bowls currently available for sale in the UK.

### Drakes Pride Professional 

**Price: £279.90**

The Drakes Pride Professional is a classic model. It’s one of the models I recommend to beginners due to its consistent line and availability on second hand markets.

Whilst it may not have the unique grips or colour schemes found in some of the newer brands, it is still a great bowl that will take you a long way.

The Professional is regularly used by players at the World Bowls Indoor championships, so you know it can be used all the way up to the top level of bowls.

You ould also consider a Drakes Pride Fineline, or a D-Tec. These are playable outdoors for leads, however I would guide you to a Professional model if you get the chance.

### Taylor Ace

**Price: £300**

In the UK this is one of the most popular models. The Ace draws slightly wider than some of the other models on the list, however, it will still play well for players of all abilities.

Taylor are now offering the Ace with the Xtreme grip, for those who are interested in the move towards embedded grips. I’ve written alot about my preference for these grips before, especially for those with grip issues.

Another bowl that is very similar to the Ace is the International. Not quite as popular as the Ace, but the draw arc is very similar. The International is cheaper than the Ace, both brand new, and second hand.

On the slightly narrower side is the Vector VS. I have seen these played outdoors, but you can get really narrow, especially on anything early in the season

### Aero Groove

**Price: £349**

The Aero Groove is a personal favourite of mine.

In my experience Aero bowls turn much earlier than many bowl models around. I prefer this, but may not be to everyone’s tastes.

The reason why I like it so much is because I feel the draw is more consistent an predictable. Older models of Aces and Professionals can have a “hooked” finish. This is when the bowl drives into the head at the very end of it’s journey. I feel this movement in a small space of time makes it vulnerable to conditions - such as wind, or patchy greens.

Aero also offer their unique Z-Scoop grip. Again its another embedded grip, and a great option for many bowlers.

### Henselite Tiger Pro

**Price: £345**

Henselite offer a couple of models in this range. The Tiger II and the Tiger Pro. The Tiger Pro does seem to be the most popular choice in the range

Henselite offer great grip and colour choices, with a strong emphasis on their unique “Slice” colour options. 

## Best Mid Biased Bowls - Australian Models

As there are different ranges for different global regions, I thought i’d outline some of the other mid-baised bowls in Australia. 

This is based on research of the models, and conversations with those who have contacted me from Australia, so if you have a personal opinion on this please feel free to reach out and correct me!

### Edge Raptor

**Price: $499**

Unique grip style, based on the old Almark brand. Edge is really trying to target a younger market, converting casual bowlers in to staple club bowlers.

A great all-rounder, it does the simple stuff well.

### Taylor SRV

**Price: $650**

A slightly tighter line than the SR model. Can handle a great variety of green speeds. Great if you are playing in different conditions regularly.

### Drakes Pride Conquest

**Price: $658**

Plays well in windy conditions. One of the most popular competitive bowls on the Australian market.

Doesn’t have any of the fancy colour of grip options, however the Conquest’s strengths are in its line consistency.

### Henselite XG

**Price: $635**

Henselite XG is a great all-rounder. It consists of a smooth draw, and a flat finish. Offers enough turn to get around all the short stuff, and will easliy play a variety of shots.

Here are some great demos of the XG in action.
